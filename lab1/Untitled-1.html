    My name is Zilun Qiu and my current major is Information management and technology, the interests that I got from this major is Project managing and information part. For the skills, I don’t know what the things that I can list for the accomplishment and skills, so I’m starting myself from the beginning. Outside of school, I like cars, car tunning is one of my favorite things, I enjoy drive fast and the engine sound. Sometimes I also go racing (legally). One unique thing that I did is I once drove from Boston to LA, takes me a week. It is a road trip and a unforgettable memory for me. Beside that, I prefer staying at home.
